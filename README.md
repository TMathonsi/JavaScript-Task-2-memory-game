# 🧠 JavaScript Task – 2: Memory Game

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of the game is to find all the matching pairs of cards.

---

## 🛠️ Setup:
1. The game board should consist of **16 cards** arranged in a **4x4 grid**.
2. Each card has a **front side and a back side**. The back side displays a **unique letter (A-H)** that forms a pair with one other card.
3. At the start of the game, **all cards are placed face down**.

---

## 🕹️ How to Play:
1. Click on any **two cards** to flip them over and reveal the letters on their back sides.
2. If the letters on the two flipped cards **match**, those cards will **remain face up**, indicating they have been successfully matched.
3. If the letters do **not match**, the cards will **flip back over** to their face-down position **after a short delay (1 second)**.
4. Continue flipping pairs of cards until **all matching pairs have been found**.

---

## 📏 Rules:
- ✅ Only **two cards can be flipped** at a time.
- 🔁 If two flipped cards do **not match**, they will be flipped back after **1 second**.
- 🏁 The game **ends** when all pairs have been successfully matched.

---

## 💡 Tips:
- 🧠 Try to **remember the positions** and letters of previously flipped cards to find matches more efficiently.
- 🔍 Start by flipping over different pairs each time to **gain more information** about the card positions.

---

## 🏆 Winning the Game:
You **win** the game when you have successfully matched **all 8 pairs of cards**, and **all cards are face up** 🎉
